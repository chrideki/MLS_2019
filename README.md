# MLS_2019

Data analytics in soccer/football is a growing and thrilling field. In this exercise, I used Phyton to scrape data about the 2019 MLS campaign from fbref.com. Then, I built a table with filters and radar charts to compare the performances of different players. A radar chart is a common tool in the professionals' daily work. For example, when it comes to scouting.

- fbref_mls.ipynb is the file with the Python code for scraping
- percentile_features.ipynb is the file with the Python code for building new columns with features ranked in percentiles
